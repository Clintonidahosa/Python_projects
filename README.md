# PYTHON PROJECTS

This repository contains projects that demonstrates my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and bioinformatics by applying algorithms such as **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Random Forest**. The analysis involves working with genomic data and others to extract meaningful insights

## Key Concepts Covered:
- Data preprocessing and normalization of datasets
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms (KNN, Random Forest)
- Model evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Functional enrichment analysis in collaboration with team members
- Data visualization techniques for exploratory analysis

## Project Highlights:
- **Predictive Modeling:** Developed KNN and Random Forest models to predict outcomes based on genetic expression data.
- **Data Exploration:** Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand patterns and relationships within the dataset.
- **Collaboration:** Worked alongside team members on functional enrichment and data processing, contributing to a comprehensive analysis of glioma subtypes.
- **Future Projects:** This repository is designed to accommodate future projects related to healthcare data analysis and machine learning, allowing for continuous growth and learning.

Feel free to explore the code and analyses within this repository!
